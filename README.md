# The-R2D2-project

Small robot project 

Goals : 
- learn use of git-hub 
- learn Arduino controller 
- learn control algorithms 
- learn AI algorithms
- learn Ros 
- built small robot 

Robot : 
- Small robot to vacuum; 

technical challanges : 
- Architecture 
- Battery 
- cleaning system 
- cleaning patrens 
- enviromental influence 

Steps : 
- step 1 
  - Architecture (driving and sucking, no accumulation) 
    - Hacking of servo motors 
    - Drivetrain (knex)
    - structure (Knex) 
    - fan = cumputer cooler
    - No battery
    - Unload doc
- step 2  
  - low level arduino control: 
    - Steering control 
    - fan on of control 
    - driving speed control
    - Unload control 
- step 3
  - Communication : 
    - communication channels?
    - Unloading doc
    - remote computer 
- Step 4
  - high level environment 
  - cleanpatern 
  -
